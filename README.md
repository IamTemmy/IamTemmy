> I build hardware that **senses the physical world, decides, and acts** — then I measure whether it actually worked.

### The operating loop

Every system I build runs the same cycle — **sense → decide → act → verify** — and loops on what it learns. It's the through-line whether the project is environmental sensing, autonomy, or control.

### Selected work

<details open>
<summary><b>plant-autonomy-testbed</b> &nbsp;—&nbsp; closed-loop · Python</summary>

<br>

A self-contained system that keeps a plant alive on its own — reads soil and reservoir state, decides when to intervene, drives a pump, and confirms the result.

> **Log ·** first build oscillated around the moisture setpoint — pump chattering on noisy reads. Fixed with hysteresis + N-sample debounce. Watering events dropped from dozens/hour to a handful/day.

<details>
<summary><b>oyster-monitoring-system</b> &nbsp;—&nbsp; field telemetry · C++</summary>

<br>

Oyster shell-gape as a live water-quality biosensor, shipped off a remote site over cellular. Presented at the JSU Research Symposium 2026.

> **Log ·** two ESP32 nodes split acquisition from uplink over UART; Hall valvometry turns shell movement into voltage; LTE handles the link with no Wi-Fi. Shipped with a documented 16-issue bug audit.

<details>
<summary><b>pilotnet-reproduction</b> &nbsp;—&nbsp; perception · Python</summary>

<br>

A faithful PyTorch reproduction of NVIDIA's PilotNet — end-to-end learning that maps camera pixels straight to steering. The ML side of turning a raw signal into an action.

### Current system

🟢 **RUNNING** &nbsp; `plant-autonomy-testbed` — closed-loop moisture control, telemetry to AWS

**Currently investigating:** *How much can an embedded system actually understand about the world it's sensing?*
